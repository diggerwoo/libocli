## 4.1 Create a command

Function create_cmd_tree() is used to create a command. Below is the specification.

```c
#define SYM_NUM(syms) (sizeof(syms)/sizeof(symbol_t))
#define SYM_TABLE(syms) &syms[0], SYM_NUM(syms)

/* Callback definition */
typedef int (*cmd_fun_t)(cmd_arg_t *, int);

/*
 * Returns struct cmd_tree * pointer, or NULL on failure.
 */
struct cmd_tree *
create_cmd_tree(char *cmd,              /* Command keyword */
                symbol_t *sym_table,    /* Pointer to symbol table */
                int sym_num,            /* Number of symbols in the table */
                cmd_fun_t fun           /* Callback function */
                );
```

The SYM_TABLE macro can be used to simplify create_cmd_tree() calls, as shown in [netutils.c](../example/netutils.c):
```c
static symbol_t syms_ping[] = {
        DEF_KEY ("ping",        "Ping utility"),
        DEF_KEY	("-c",          "Set count of requests"),
        /* ... */
};

static int cmd_ping(cmd_arg_t *cmd_arg, int do_flag);

int cmd_ping_init()
{
        struct cmd_tree *cmd_tree;
        cmd_tree = create_cmd_tree("ping", SYM_TABLE(syms_ping), cmd_ping);
        /* ... */
}
```

The callback function type **cmd_fun_t** has two parameters:
- The first is a pointer of type **cmd_arg_t**, which points to the array of callback argument. For details please refer to [2.2 Passing callback arguments](Symbol%20Definition.md#22-passing-callback-arguments). 
- The second is a integer that we always use "do_flag" to represent. It is related to the "no" syntax. If the command is started with "no", then (do_flag & UNDO_FLAG) will be True, otherwise the (do_flag & DO_FLAG) will be Ture. Apparently the "ping" command doesn't have the "no" syntax. whilst other configuration commands like the "route" need this. We use "route ..." to add a static route, also use "no route ..." to delete one. Please refer to [route.c](../example/route.c).

## 4.2 Register a syntax

Functions add_cmd_easily() and add_cmd_syntax() can all be used to register a syntax.
```c
/* Predefined VIEW, each coresponds to one bit */
#define	BASIC_VIEW		0x0001
#define	ENABLE_VIEW		0x0002
#define	CONFIG_VIEW		0x0004

/* Bit definition of do_flag. */
#define	DO_FLAG		0x01
#define	UNDO_FLAG	0x02

/* Register a syntax, and create the manual line for this syntax. Returns 0 on success, else -1 */
int add_cmd_easily(struct cmd_tree *cmd_tree,   /* Pointer returned by create_cmd_tree() */
                   char *syntax,                /* Syntax string */
                   int view_mask,               /* VIEW mask, can be OR result of multi VIEW */
                   int do_flag                  /* OR result of DO_FLAG, UNDO_FLAG */
                   );

/* Register a syntax only. Returns 0 on success, else -1 */
int add_cmd_syntax(struct cmd_tree *cmd_tree,
                   char *syntax,
                   int view_mask,
                   int do_flag);

```

We give several typical sytax registration examples as below.

1. Register a "ping" syntax. As done in [netutils.c](../example/netutils.c), this syntax can be accessed in all VIEW except the BASIC_VIEW and dosen't support "no" usage, so the last parameter is DO_FLAG.
    ```c
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "ping [ -c COUNT ] [ -s SIZE ] { HOST | HOST_IP } [ from IFADDR ]",
                   (ALL_VIEW_MASK & ~BASIC_VIEW), DO_FLAG);
    ```

2. Register "enable" and "enable password" syntaxes in different VIEWs, as done in [democli.c](../example/democli.c).
    ```c
    /* Reigster "enable" in BASIC_VIEW, which is used to input the enabled password */
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "enable", BASIC_VIEW, DO_FLAG);

    /* Register "enable password" in ENABLE_VIEW, which is used to update the enabled password */
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "enable password", ENABLE_VIEW, DO_FLAG);
    ```

3. Register the "[no] route" syntax. Now the do_flag is set to (DO_FLAG | UNDO_FLAG). This is a configuration command so it is only accessible in CONFIG_VIEW. Refer to [route.c](../example/route.c).
    ```c
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "route DST_NET DST_MASK GW_ADDR", CONFIG_VIEW, (DO_FLAG | UNDO_FLAG));
    ```

4. For the previous example, you might think the GW_ADDR is redundant when you use "no route" to delete static route, because (DST_NET + DST_MAKE) is actually the primary key of the route table. If you really want to optimize this, you need to do syntax splitting and register an UNDO_FLAG syntax independently, as shown below.
    ```c
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "route DST_NET DST_MASK GW_ADDR", CONFIG_VIEW, DO_FLAG);
    add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "route DST_NET DST_MASK", CONFIG_VIEW, UNDO_FLAG);
    ```
## 4.3 Customized view

Libocli predefines three views: BASIC_VIEW, ENABLE_VIEW and CONFIG_VIEW. The initial view of the democli is BASIC_VIEW. User inputs "enable" and enter  password to access ENABLE_VIEW, and then inputs "configure terminal" to access CONFIG_VIEW. Only then can user update system configuration. Each time the view is changed, the prompt also changes. The prompt lets user easily know current privilege status. For how democli change the view/prompt, refer to  democli_set_view() function in [sys.c](../example/sys.c).

You can also add customized view, or even use the customized view completely and ignore the Libocli predefined views.

We give a use case of customized view. A customized INTERFACE_VIEW is defined in [democli.h](../example/democli.h) to demonstrate how to implement Cisco style "interface" commands.
```c
#define INTERFACE_VIEW	0x08
```
Then we create "interface" and "ip" commands in cmd_interface() of [interface.c](../example/interface.c). The "interface IFNAME" syntax is only accessible in CONFIG_VIEW, and the "ip address" syntax is only accessible in INTERFACE_VIEW:
```c
int
cmd_interface_init()
{
	struct cmd_tree *cmd_tree;

	cmd_tree = create_cmd_tree("interface", SYM_TABLE(syms_interface), cmd_interface);
	add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "interface IFNAME", CONFIG_VIEW, DO_FLAG);

	cmd_tree = create_cmd_tree("ip", SYM_TABLE(syms_ip), cmd_ip);
	add_cmd_easily(cmd_tree, "ip address IP_ADDR NET_MASK", INTERFACE_VIEW, DO_FLAG);

	return 0;
}
```
The effect is that after user enters the "interface" command in CONFIG_VIEW, such as "interface eth0", user can access INTERFACE_VIEW in which the "ip address" command can be accessible to configure the eth0's IP address.

## 4.4 Usage and limitation of reserved syntax chars

Libocli allows to use **[ ] { | }** for optional / alternative segments when registering syntax:
- **Alternative** segment **{ | }**  , allows two of more tokens separated by '**|**' . E.g. " { block | pass } "，" { tcp | udp | icmp } "
- **Optional** segment **[  ]**, each segment can have multiple tokens. E.g. " [ -c COUNT ] [ -s PKT_SIZE ] "

Limitaions:
- SPACE must be present between reserved chars, or between reserved char and other tokens.
- NO **[ ]** or **{ }** are allowed to be nested inside **{ }**.
- **{ }** can be nested inside **[ ]**. E.g.  " [ from { IP_ADDR | IFNAME } ] "


## 4.5 Add customized manual

If you do not want to use the manual generated automatically by add_cmd_easily(), but need to create a customized one, you can call the add_cmd_manual(), then call add_cmd_syntax(). The function add_cmd_manual() is defined as below.

```c
int add_cmd_manual(struct cmd_tree *cmd_tree,	/* Pointer to command tree */
		   char *text,			/* Manual text */
		   int view_mask		/* VIEW mask */*
		   );
```

When using "man" to read the manual, Libocli displays the manual text line by line, in the order in which the manual text was added.
